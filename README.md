# Project Overview

This is a web site that integrates database functionality, server-side logic, and client-side interaction. The project uses the following technologies:

- **Node.js:** Used as the server-side runtime environment for JavaScript.
- **Express.js:** A web application framework for Node.js used to build the server-side logic.
- **PostgreSQL:** A powerful open-source relational database used for storing and managing data.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** Used for authentication and authorization purposes.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** Frontend technologies used for creating the user interface and interactivity.
- **Express-Validator:** Middleware for validation of request data.
- **dotenv:** Used for loading environment variables from a .env file into process.env.
- **pg (node-postgres):** A PostgreSQL client for Node.js used for interacting with the PostgreSQL database.
- **Express-Flash:** Used for flashing messages to the user.
- **Express-Session:** Middleware for managing sessions in Express.js.
- **Bcrypt:** Library for hashing passwords.
- **ESLint:** A tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in JavaScript code.
- **Prettier:** An opinionated code formatter.
- **Morgan:** HTTP request logger middleware for Node.js.
- **Nodemon:** Utility that automatically restarts the server when changes are detected in the file system.

These technologies collectively enable the development of a web application with features such as user authentication, database interactions, form validation, and more.
